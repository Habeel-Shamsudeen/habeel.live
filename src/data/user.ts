  about: `
Hi, I’m Habeel — a Software Engineer passionate about building reliable, high-performance web applications with a focus on clean architecture and seamless user experiences.

With over a year of experience, I’ve contributed to startups like Oddsview (YC W24), where I worked on building scalable Python-based web scrapers and optimized infrastructure using AWS CDK. I also interned as a full-stack developer at YouseAI, gaining hands-on experience in modern frontend and backend technologies.

Currently, I’m building GradeIT, an online platform designed to simplify the evaluation of coding assignments through automated test case generation, constraint checking, and plagiarism detection — all powered by modern full-stack development practices.

My tech stack includes Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and I’m actively exploring areas like DevOps and advanced backend communication. Outside of development, I enjoy learning new skills, exploring ideas through side projects, and collaborating with other developers to bring innovative solutions to life.

Let's connect and collaborate!
