  about: `
  Hi, I'm Habeel — I build fast, reliable web applications that help businesses scale.
  
  I specialize in full-stack development with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Python. I've worked with startups like Oddsview (YC W24) to build high-performance systems that handle real-time data, optimize infrastructure, and reduce costs.
  
  What I can help you with:
  - Building modern web apps from scratch — landing pages, dashboards, SaaS products
  - Optimizing slow or unreliable systems for better performance
  - Integrating APIs, authentication, payments, and third-party services
  - Setting up cloud infrastructure with AWS, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Redis
  
  Whether you need a new product built or an existing one improved, I focus on clean code, fast delivery, and solutions that actually work.
  
  Currently building GradeIT — an automated code grading platform that reduces manual evaluation time by 70% through secure sandboxed execution and AI-powered test generation.
  
  Let's talk about your project.
